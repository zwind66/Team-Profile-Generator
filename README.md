# Team-Profile-Generator

![Github licence](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

The goal of this project is to build a Node.js command line application. It generates an HTML page that displays team information by receiving user-entered information about team employees. This application will use constructors and classes to create employee objects. These include employee, manager, engineer and intern classes. In addition to building the application, this project needs to test every part of the code with Jest and Inquirer to make sure it passes every test. A demo of the node application and tests is shown below.

## User Story

    AS A manager
    I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
    SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

## Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
    WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
    THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
    WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
    THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
    WHEN I click on the GitHub username
    THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
    WHEN I start the application
    THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
    WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
    THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
    WHEN I select the engineer option
    THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
    WHEN I select the intern option
    THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
    WHEN I decide to finish building my team
    THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
